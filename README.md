# RouteManager
This mod is VERY barebones. The purpose of this mod is to allow people to automate passenger service. This mod does not automate the throwing of switches for the passenger train. You must ensure the switches are thrown properly for the passenger train for the time being. The mod currently does not support automating freight.  More features will be added in the future to expand the capabilities of this mod, but for right now this mod only automates passenger service.

Usage:

Select a locomotive (preferably with coaches coupled)

Go to the 'Orders' Panel

Select 'Road' mode

(!NOTE! before continuing know that currently, the train will go to the first station you select regardless of whether you select additional stations on the way)

You can select any station you want your train to stop at. The order in which you select stations does not matter as the train will go in the order that stations appear on the line.

The Route Manager Logic will take over and stop your train at every station you have selectedâ€”no need to worry about selecting passengers in the coaches either. The Route Manager will take care of that as well!

Make sure to keep track of the coal and water remaining in your locomotive as there is currently no check for low fuel/water
