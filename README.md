# RouteManager
This mod is VERY barebones. The purpose of this mod is to allow people to automate passenger service. This mod does not automate the throwing of switches for the passenger train. You must ensure the switches are thrown properly for the passenger train for the time being. The mod currently does not support automating freight.  More features will be added in the future to expand the capabilities of this mod, but for right now this mod only automates passenger service.

**Configuration:**

*For BepInEx Users*

| Alerts | DieselLevel|  Minimum Fuel Quantity (Gallons) to depart station / warn  en-route  | Float | 100 | value  >= 0
| Dev | NewInterface  | Allows access do DEV features | Bool | False |

*For Unity Mod Manager Users*
Configuration can be done via the in-game Unity Mod Manager interface.

2. Click the options icon next to 'Dispatcher'

Settings changes take effect immediately, but will only save for next time if the 'Save' button at the bottom of the window is clicked.

**Notes:**

- Dev features are unsupported and listed only for completeness of documentation.

**Notes:**

1. The Route Manager Logic will take over and stop your train at every station you have selectedâ€”no need to worry about selecting passengers in the coaches either. The Route Manager will take care of that as well!

2. ~~Make sure to keep track of the coal and water remaining in your locomotive as there is currently no check for low fuel/water~~
Basic alerting of low consumables has been implemented as of v1.0.2.0

***

**Building From Source:**

Note: This assumes you have some fundamental understanding of how Github & visual studio work and so is intended more as a quick start than a full guide.
 1. Download and install Visual Studio community edition. Not visual Studio Code.
 2. Clone / download this repository to your computer.
 3. Open the Project solution.
 4. If your game install is not in the default location (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Railroader`) follow these steps to add the correct references
     1. Create a user solution file `Directory.Build.targets` in the root of the project (where 'RouteManager.sln' is). There is an example file you can copy
     2. Update the `GamePath` property so it points to the base of your Railroader install
 5. Build the solution
	* If you are using BepInEx, 'RouteManager.BepInEx.dll' and 'config.ini' will be copied to the 'BepInEx\plugins' folder
	* If you are using Unity Mod Manager, 'RouteManager.UMM.dll' and 'info.json' will be copied to the 'Mods\RouteManager' folder
	
Note: If the build config is set to 'Release' zip archives containing the necessary files will be created for both mod loader types in the solution's 'Release' folder
